Abstract
--------
Discrete environmental stressors, such as prolonged periods of extreme temperature or low
oxygen, threaten the functioning of marine ecosystems. While considerable attention has been
given to studying extremes occurring in isolation, our understanding of such events co-occurring
in the water column–referred to as multi-stressor events or compound extremes–is still limited,
despite their potentially synergistic effects on individual species. We use a historical ocean
model simulation with biogeochemistry to characterize the frequency, intensity, and duration of
multi-stressor events (temperature, chlorophyll, and oxygen) in the California Current Large
Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) from 1996–2019. We highlight key spatiotemporal patterns of
compound physical and biogeochemical extremes in the context of large-scale climate
variability, particularly ENSO. Marine heatwaves and low chlorophyll extremes are generally
associated with strong El Ni&ntilde;o events, while shallow hypoxia extremes are generally associated
with La Ni&ntilde;a events. Marine heatwave-low chlorophyll extremes are the most common
compound extreme in nearshore waters, while triple extremes are relatively rare, as conditions
favoring warm and low productivity anomalies tend to also favor high oxygen anomalies.
Results from this study advance our understanding of where and when multi-stressor events tend
to occur in the CCLME, highlighting spatiotemporal characteristics that suggest potential
sources of predictability, which could be leveraged in the ecosystem-based management of
living marine resources.
